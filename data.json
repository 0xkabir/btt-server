A symbol of the Incan Empire and built around 1450AD, Machu Picchu was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 and was named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in 2007 One of the most popular reasons to visit Machu Picchu is its popular hiking trail. The Inca Trail is almost as well known as the wonder of the world. This hiking route is chosen by hundreds of tourists every year, so much so that it is necessary to book months in advance. The monument of Inca architecture receives approximately a million of tourists a year. Machu Picchu, currently one of the 7 wonders of the world, is an impressive Inca fortress with temples, platforms and water channels, located at the top of a mountain of the Valley of Urubamba River, 2 360 m.a.s.l."
